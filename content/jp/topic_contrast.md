# Topic / Contrast Marker は
は is not a case particle. 

## Topic
The topic is what the sentence is about. To constitute as a topic, the entity must be "registered information." To become registered information, the entity must first be established with the subject marker or be common sense. If the subject continues to be the topic after the fact, do not use Ｘはが; only Ｘは. 

A good way to feel **topicalization** is to translate Xは to "As for X..." When used this way, は is pronounced "wa." The topic can be omitted from the sentence when it can be inferred (e.g., general "it").

Like how the topic marker can be translated as, "As for...", Xは can also serve as, "At least X..." It's actually has a sort of double function as a topic marker too. 

For questions, the interrogative does not make up the topic. This is because the topic would be relevant to the lister as well.

## Contrast
Multiple は can appear in a sentence. Only one serves as the topic marker; the others are for contrasting with other options. A sneaky example of the contrast marker is, 『**本当**は嬉しいです。』 — "I'm **actually** happy." This sentence contrasts with "I may **appear** unhappy."
