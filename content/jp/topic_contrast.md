# Topic / Contrast Marker は
は is not a case particle. It should also be noted that the particle is pronounced "wa."

## Topic
To constitute as a topic, the entity must be "registered information." To become registered information, the entity must first be established with the subject marker or be common sense. Even if it turns out the listener isn't aware of the information, the marker does offer some leniancy. For questions, the interrogative does not make up the topic. This is because the topic would be relevant to the lister as well.

[what is that last sentence]: #
A good way to feel **topicalization** is to translate Xは to "As for X." Also, Xはが is not grammatical. That is not to say that the topic is always the subject, however.

[TODO: what the hell is the difference between topic and subject]: #
[the sentence is about the topic? the topic acts on the subject?]: #
Like how the topic marker can be translated as, "As for...", Xは can also serve as, "At least X..." It's actually has a sort of double function as a topic marker too. 

## Contrast
Multiple は can appear in a sentence. Only one serves as the topic marker; the others are for contrasting with other options. It is commonly used in negative sentences, but it can be used as a way to deflect as well. For example, 『本当は嬉しいです。』 *"I'm actually happy."* contrasts with "I may appear unhappy."
