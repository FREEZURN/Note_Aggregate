## Japanese 
topic + time + location + subject + indirect object + direct object + verb/adjective

- Predicative Form: used at the end of the sentence
- Attributive Form: modifies a noun
- Continuative Form: actions that are being carried out

[TODO: what is a grammatical role]: #
Speech registers
- Polite: equals who are not friends or family
- Plain: grammatical roles, with friends and family
- Vulgar: insulting; degrade the listener

- ねぇ: a final particle that adds a tone of relief. 

## が
Using には to mark the possessor (of an item) leaves the door open for someone else to own said object of their own. For example, 『私**には**兄がいます。』 — "I **for one** have an older brother."

が may be omitted in the necessity case if said necessity is too overwhelming. See 『**このお菓子**、要る？』 — "Do you really want **this candy**?"

## ある & いる
These verbs either tell that something simply exists or demonstrate possession.
- ある: inanimate objects
- いる: living beings or social constructs (e.g., family)

For "there," just using the is copula is only applicable for a specific situation. Take 『夕ご飯はカレーでした。』 — "There was curry for dinner." ある would work if there was no dinner part.

There is a conjugation pattern for verbs to turn it existential? 『銀行に**勤めています**。』 — "I **work** at the bank."

## Adjectival Nouns
である is the uncontracted form of だ.

Some adjectival-nouns were created from an adjective by dropping the ～い and replacing it with either ～か, ～らか, or ～やか. Other adjectival-nouns were created from loanwords.

『**すばしっこい茶色**の狐はのろまな犬を飛び越える。』 — "The **quick brown** fox jumps over the lazy dog." Chaining modifications of three different types (adjective, adjectival noun, noun).

こと as the modified noun is simply a generic; 『彼女の**こと**が気になっている。』 — "I’m concerned about \[**something regarding**\] her."

When a verb is the final part of a compound expression, it is turned into its continuative form then followed with の. Now use it attributively. However, just using the attributive form of the verb is slowing coming back. 『土砂降りの雨』 — "Pouring rain."

In historical writing, の can be written as 之 or 乃.

## を
Motion through something: 行く ("to do") succeeds the particle に for physical destinations, and を for more abstract (but not necessarily philosophical) ones.

When the direction (marked by を) of an action is not a literal direction-word (e.g., south), append のほう (の方) to the direction. 

For origin of departure, there exists two potential case particles. から is for physical departure points and implies a greater purpose for the action. を, on the other hand, hones in on "leaving" and comes with a feeling of conclusion. 

Fluctuation in degree: "The amount **exceeded** 100 million dollars."

Transition of time: for transitive verbs, it is imperative that を attaches to nouns that imply a period of time. Intransitive verbs, explicit time phrases.

## する
- "To cost" is intransitive
- "To sense" is intransitive (because sensing is beyond our control)
- "To be (an occupation)" changes する to すている for an 'active statement.' Then apply the conjugations to the す and る.

## と
Sometimes, in old proverbs, と may appear attached to verbs that have not been nominalized. However, due to old grammar, using the attributive form counted as nominalization.

To connect clauses, use そして (そうして is the uncontracted form) or また. For example, 『そして、夜11時に寝ました。』 — "And I went to bed at 11 P.M." This is not a complete solution; there are some sentences that hide the fact that the two phrases are not actually nouns. For example, 『私は日本人**で**医者です。』 — "I am Japanese **and** a doctor." This translation actually hides the fact that two predicate phrases are being connected: "I am Japanese and I am a doctor." In any case, the special circumstance to be using そして and the like is when building off immediately previous information (e.g., as "then" or adding information with "and").

Not saying "to" can have the subtle message that the following items are not as important.

For the "with" definition, using と has a nuance in that whoever is associated is brought to an equal level, socially or role-wise, as the subject. On role-wise, consider 『友達と会う。』 — "To meet with a friend." It is implied that both parties are moving to see each other, as opposed to one going to the other.

## か
The contexts in which か typically appear in plain questions is either by a man or rhetorical questions. This particle also is to be used with people the speaker is familiar with.

With the question word, placing the copula verb in a plain question is usually by a man. In a similar vein, よ without the copula verb makes the question more feminine.

The responses はい and いいえ. Answer はい to affirm the validity of the question even if it's structured negatively; the emphatic response, "No," in English sometimes translates to はい.
- 「そう思わないんですか？」 — "Do you not think so?"
- 「**はい**、思いませんね。」 — "**No**, I don't."

[here & there]: #
The particles よ and ね (in that order) at sentence end express a desire for direct confirmation from the listener.

## こそあど
The plural forms (e.g., それら) are frequently followed by すべて. Think of this phrase as a generic. In this case, do not drop the ら. 『名前も過去も履歴も、**それらすべて**を手放した。』 — "My name, my past, my background, I let go of **all those things**."

## へ
への is correct; にの is never correct.

The circumstance in which へ appears with 来る is to imply that the starting point is a far away. 

「ニューヨークを**発って**シドニーへ**向かいました**。」 — "I left New York **for** Sydney." Notice where the two verbs are placed and how they're merged into one sentence.
