[TODO: need to talk about conjugations of auxiliary verbs themselves]: # 
# Auxiliary Verbs
Auxiliary verbs do not share meanings with their standalone counterparts. They attach to the te-form conjugation.

## Commands
Conjugating the *predicate verb* with te-form turns the sentence into a light command. A negative conjugation must use ～ないで.「見つめ**ないで**！」 — "Don't stare \[at me\]!"

Attached to the end are often the auxiliary verbs that mean '*to give*.' The effect is that it changes the tone from a light command. くれる creates a gentle request: 「もっとゆっくりと話して**くれません**か。」 — "Could you please speak more slowly?"

ください makes a polite command: 「払い戻しをして**ください**。」 — "Please refund this."

くれ is really only for vulgar speech registers; it generates a crude command: 「やめて**くれ**！」 — "Quit it!"

At the end of all this, the question particle か may be placed to make the sentence politer. Other final particles may be used too; よ can add a bit of urgency, whereas や creates a scolding tone.

[TODO: does this have an attributive form]: #
## ～いる and ～ある
The affirmative te-form can be followed with ～いる or ～ある. Tenses, politeness, and negativity are handled by conjugating the auxiliary verbs like their standalone counterparts. These apply only to verbs.

-# ～ている is commonly contracted to ～てる, even in polite conversation.

The primary use is to say that the subject is in the process of carrying out the action. This action takes time to complete. 「お風呂はもう**沸いています**か。」 — "Is the bath **hot** yet?" The progressive perfect tenses (e.g., had been -ing) are handled automatically. 

～いる is able to note that the associated action is something the subject habitually does. For example, 「A学校に**通っています**。」 — "I **go** to School A." Though, context may be necessary to distinguish from the progressive. 

～いる may also be used when talking about actions in the past *from a historical perspective*. Some examples to consider:
- 「アレックスさんはもう10回も日本に**旅行しています**よ。」 — "Alex has already **traveled** to Japan 10 times."
- 「阿部元首相が亡くなってからもう一年**経っている**んだね。」 — "A year has already **passed** since Former Prime Minister Abe passed away, huh."

When a state began with an action, and said action is continuing, ～いる may be used. For example, 「この机は**壊れています**。」 — "This desk is **broken**." The desk broke somehow any time ago, and it is still broken now. This use is commonly paired with verbs that happen almost instantly; it happened some time ago in an instant, and the state has not changed since. 

-# With motion verbs, the subject already made their way to the destination, and is still there.

[this is exclusively predicate]: #
～ある expands on this particular function specifically for transitive verbs. It suggests that there was a *willing agent* behind the action. This agent is the subject, but because the verb is now a *stative-transitive verb*, the object is also the subject. The agent, thus, is omitted. 「彼の熱は**計ってある**。」 — "His temperature was **checked** \[**by someone**\]." For past tense, the state could or could not be currently persisting.
