# "Also" Particle も
も is a case and adverbial particle. To the noun it attaches to, も typically conveys that said noun is the same as something else previously discussed. Take the sentence, 『**僕**もお腹が空いた。』 — "**I**'m hungry, too." In a way, the Japanese version is more detailed as it marks what the "too" applies to, instead of relying on established context. It must be noted, though, that even if the noun is the topic, subject or object, も supersedes such case particles (notice how *I* is also the topic, but there is no は).

There are some peculiar patterns involving the particle:
- XもYも...Aも: "X, Y... and A"
- XもX: To describe how something was so much like X
