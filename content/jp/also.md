# "Also" Particle も
も is a case and adverbial particle. It conveys that the associated noun has an identical trait to something else. Take the sentence, 「**僕**もお腹が空いた。」 — "**I**'m hungry, *too*." In a way, Japanese is more particular as it specifies what the "too" applies to. It must be noted, though, that even if the noun is the topic, subject, or object, も supersedes such case particles. 

There are some peculiar patterns involving the particle:
- XもYも...Aも: "X, Y... and A" (without reference to previous context)
- XもX: Generate an enthusiastic expression about how something (not necessarily a noun) is so much like X

-# 「**真ん中も真ん中**、ど真ん中の好球!」 — "Such a great throw right in the center, **smack-dab in the center**!"
