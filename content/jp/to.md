# The Particle と

## "And"
As a parallel particle, と means "and." To be used as such, the two phrases that surround it *must be nouns*. However, it is not to be used to connect clauses. 

-# If also placed on the final noun, a significant contrast is conveyed between all the nouns.

In writing, the と may be replaced with ・. It is still read as "to," though. When there are three or more items, it may become common to see the ，in the format 『AとB、C』. The "to" is still spoken between each item. 

## "With"
と can also serve as a case particle, marking with whom or what the subject is performing an action **with**. Multiple と's can appear with different functions, so be careful. For example, 『**父と母**と公園に行きます。』 — "I'm going to the park with **my father and mother**."

As opposed to simply saying that the other party accompanied, use と一緒に or と共に to communicate that the other party is working **together with** the subject. The latter is more formal. See the sentence 『彼らは**敵**と一緒に戦っていた。』 — "They fought together with **the enemy**." The と is frequently omitted, though.
