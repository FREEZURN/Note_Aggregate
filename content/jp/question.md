# Question Particle か
A final particle terminates a sentence. か is one such particle, and it indicates that the associated sentence is a question.

## Polite
One of the simplest questions to ask is whether something—the topic—is something or doing something. As long as it is a polite sentence, just add the か at the end of the sentence. 

Slightly more complex questions can be asked when the predicate is a question *noun*. Of course, don't forget the copula verb conjugated politely followed by か. This makes it so that the question is asking for details about the topic.

-# 何 is pronounced なん when used this way.

When the question word is taken out of the predicate and becomes the subject and is followed by the predicate of a basic question, the question now seeks more specific information regarding the topic.　For example, 『座席はどこがいいですか。』 *"What seat\[s\] are good?"* When the topic marker is omitted, not only may the sentence require more context, but it also comes off as more direct.

By placing a の or ん right before the politeness marker, the speaker's interest is conveyed to the listener. Without か, the question gains a serious yet soft tone.

-# ん is more common in speech because it's a contraction of の.

## Plain
In plain sentences, か is largely not used. Instead, a raised intonation or ？ is used. However, if it were to be used, it'll likely be by a man. In that case, if there is a predicate copula, it is dropped and leaves the か. Another reason that か may be used in plain (and polite) contexts is for rhetorical questions.

When a question word is used as the predicate, there's the current option of ending the sentence there, or following it with the copula verb. This latter option is preferred by men. In either case, adding よ at the very end adds emphasis to the question. 

## Negative
There is a caveat to all this: it cannot be used willy-nilly on negative conjugations. For the polite speech register, just adding the か is simply asking for reconfirmation in a stylistic way. However, with a conjugation of ～ないです, inserting either a の or ん right before the politeness marker usually creates a basic question regarding whether or not the "not" applies; it conveys genuine curiosity. For example, a question about one's intention without either of those two conveys that the speaker is certain that that person will do it (and that said person is also certain). ～ません doesn't have exactly the same trick, but it (by itself) is usually used to politely invite someone to do something (with a か at the end, of course). 

The same principles of plain speech apply. But it usually is a means to invite someone. However, adding か means that the speaker is very familiar with the listener, and it also has a masculine tone to it. Place a の in between and the question becomes serious and emotional, with the off-chance of being sarcastic or rhetorical. Add another の (final particle) at the end to make the question even more serious.

There are special cases for negative copular. Of course, there is always the basic question case, but it can also be a exaggerated mean to state the obvious. The general の/ん case exists, and it gets placed directly before the copular. 

-# ～じゃんか is a dialectal simplification of ～じゃないか. Without the か, it is a tone softener for an affirmative-yet-casual statement.
