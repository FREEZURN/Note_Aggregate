# Question Particle か
A final particle terminates a sentence. か is one such particle, and it indicates that the associated sentence is a question.

## Non-Negative
One of the simplest questions to ask is whether the topic is something or doing something. For a polite register, simply put the か at the end of the sentence. In plain, a raised intonation or ？; though, if か is desired, remove the copula if present.

Marginally more complex questions can be asked when the predicate contains a question word. Remember: a question word is a noun, so it requires the copula verb followed by か in the polite register. For the plain register, the copula verb is optional; there must be a rising intonation if omitted.

-# 何 is pronounced なん when used this way.

-# In plain speech, adding よ at the end will emphasize the question.

[TODO: exclusively for polite?]: #
When the question word is taken out of the predicate and becomes the subject, and it is followed by the predicate of a basic question, the question now seeks more specific information regarding the topic.　For example, 「座席はどこが**いいです**か。」 — "What seats are **good**?"

[TODO: this applies to the negative too]: #
In polite register, placing a の or ん right before the politeness marker, the speaker's curiosity is conveyed to the listener. For the plain register, appending の (but no か) adds a serious yet soft tone to the question.

-# ん, a contraction of の, is more common in speech.

## Negative
For the polite speech register, just adding the か is simply asking for affirmation in a stylistic way; you are fairly confident that it is true. However, with the conjugation ～ないです and the like, inserting either a の or ん right before the ～ですか usually creates a basic question regarding the negative status. For copula conjugations, the の or ん are placed before the entire verb. The politeness marker ～ません is usually used to invite someone to do something (e.g., 「パイナップルを漬けませんか。」 — "Why not pickle pineapple?").

-# ～じゃんか is a dialectal simplification of ～じゃないか. Without the か, it is a tone softener for an affirmative-yet-casual statement. For example, 「いいじゃん！」 — "Fine with me!"

The same limitations on か from non-negative plain apply in negative plain too. These questions are usually for soliciting someone, though. If か is present, placing a の just before it causes the question to become serious and emotional, with the off-chance of being sarcastic or rhetorical. The final particle の makes the question even more serious.
