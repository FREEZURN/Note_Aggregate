# Particles for Verbs

## Direct Object を
This case particle attaches to *whatever is receiving the transitive action*. を is typically pronounced /o/ in this and the transition context.

## Object が
A **stative verb** (e.g., have or need) simply expresses a state or condition of the subject. The subject has no control over their state of being. Obviously the verb is associated with the action; thus, the object is *the descriptor*. Stative verbs can either be transitive or intransitive. Alternatively, an adjective or adjectival noun may serve a similar function. For example, 「**妖怪**が怖い！」 — "I'm scared of **ghosts**."

-# The example sentence may be interpreted as "Ghosts are scary!" too (using が as the subject marker), depending on the context.

## Indirect Object に
An indirect object is simply another, optional-yet-crucial entity that is associated with the action. It commonly is the recipient. Consider, 「ケイトさんは**テイラー君**にチョコをくれました。」 — "Kate-san gave **Taylor-kun** chocolate." に may also appear for intransitive verbs and adjectives. For an adjectival example, 「セスさんは**カタルーニャ語**にも詳しいですよ。」 — "Seth-san is also knowledgeable in **Catalan**."

-# The direct object in English can sometimes be the indirect object in Japanese.

[TODO: the difference between indirect object and this is that the subject has control]: #
## Transition を
The main thing about を is that it indicates control by the agent. Coincidentally, there are some intransitive actions in which the agent is in control. If extra detail about the action is to be given (akin to direct object), then mark that detail with を. For example, 「その金額は**1億ドル**を上回りました。」 — "The amount exceeded **100 million dollars**." 

-# When two を appear in the same sentence, the first one gets omitted, but it semantically remains.

## Means で
で marks the means **with** which the action is carried out.
