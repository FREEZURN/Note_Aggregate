# Particles for Verbs

## Direct Object を
This case particle attaches to *whatever is receiving the transitive action*. を is typically pronounced "o" in this and the following context.

## Transition を
The main thing about を is that it indicates control by the agent. Coincidentally, there are some intransitive actions in which the agent is in control. If extra detail about the action is to be given (akin to direct object), then mark that detail with を. For example, 『その金額は**1億ドル**を上回りました。』 — "The amount exceeded **100 million dollars**." 

-# When two を appear in the same sentence, the first one gets omitted, but it semantically remains.

## Object
A **stative verb** simply expresses a state or condition, like *have* or *need*. These can either be transitive or intransitive. Alternatively, an adjective. Either way, they make up the predicate. For these sentences, the object is marked with が because the "doer" inherently has no control over their state.
