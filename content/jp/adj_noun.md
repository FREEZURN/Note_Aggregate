# Adjectival Nouns
Adjectival nouns are nouns that can also function as adjectives—the degree of which varies. They possess a attributive and predicate form. 

## Conjugations
Adjectival nouns must be conjugated to act as an adjective. However, these conjugations are unique in that those of copula verb are simply appended. The exception is attributive non-past, where the conjugation is not only different but also situational. 

-# Polite forms do not have an attributive form.

～である attaches to the predicate of a clause that is modifying a noun. This predicate can either be a noun or adjectival-noun. Interestingly, the adjectival-noun can be the predicate for the entire sentence and can still be attached with ～である. 

～な is for a non-predicate adjectival noun that is modifying a noun. It is also able to replace ～である when the sentence is existential in nature.

～の is for a non-predicative noun modifying another noun. In fact, の is a particle, not a conjugation.
