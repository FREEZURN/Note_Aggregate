# Adjectival Nouns
Adjectival nouns are nouns that can also function as adjectives—the degree of which varies. They possess a attributive and predicate form. 

## Conjugations
Adjectival nouns must be conjugated to act as an adjective. However, these conjugations are unique in that those of copula verb are simply appended. The exception is attributive non-past, where the conjugation is not only different but also situational. 

-# Polite forms do not have an attributive form.

～である attaches to the predicate of a clause that is modifying a noun. This predicate can either be a noun or adjectival-noun. Interestingly, the adjectival-noun can be the predicate for the entire sentence and can still be attached with ～である. 

～な is for a non-predicate adjectival noun that is modifying a noun. It is also able to replace ～である when the sentence is existential in nature.

～の is for a non-predicative noun modifying another noun. の is a case particle, not a conjugation. One way it is used is when the modifier noun is actually the parent vertex of which the modified noun is a child of; a way to think about is is の as "'s." For example, 『雲**の**形』 — "Cloud**'s** shape." This quirk can be used with relative nouns (e.g., 下) as the modified noun in order to produce adverbs like through, while, and time when. For example, 『**子供の頃**は病弱でした。』 — "I was sickly **when I was a kid**." Alternatively, the modifier noun is simply an attribute (e.g., appearance or purpose) of the modified noun. のs can be chained to a series of nouns. 

-# The subject is always the modified noun.

-# A comma may replace の if the circumstance permits.

-# A non-predicate adjectival noun may serve as a modifier noun if it is what is known as a "no-adjectival noun." Compared to な, の is more empathetic and "personal." Adverbs are also possible.
