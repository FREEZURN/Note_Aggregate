# Adjectival Nouns
Adjectival nouns are nouns that can function as adjectives—the degree of which varies. 

## Conjugations
Adjectival nouns must be conjugated to be recognized as an adjective. However, these conjugations are unique in that **they simply append those of だ except for non-past**, where the conjugation is situational. 

-# Non-past does not include future-tense as much. To be interpreted as such, context needs to be established.

-# Polite forms do not have an attributive form.

For non-past conjugations, the oddities mainly refer to the attributive form; the predicative form is also either ～だ or ～です depending on the speech register. 

～である is for the predicate of a clause that is modifying a noun. This predicate can either be a noun or adjectival-noun. Interestingly, the adjectival-noun can be the predicate for the entire sentence and can still be attached with ～である. In this instance, it becomes like a copula.

[TODO: it seems that it's a copula conjugation for predicative noun modifying a noun at the end of the sentence]: #
～な is for a non-predicate adjectival noun that is modifying a noun. Think of it as the attributive alternative to ～である. It is also able to replace ～である when the sentence is existential in nature.

～の is for a non-predicative noun modifying another noun. In fact, の is a particle, not a conjugation.
