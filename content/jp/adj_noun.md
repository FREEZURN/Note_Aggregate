# Adjectival Nouns
Adjectival nouns are nouns that can also function as adjectives—the degree of which varies. They possess a attributive and predicate form. 

## Conjugations
Adjectival nouns must be conjugated to act as an adjective. However, these conjugations are unique in that those of copula verb are simply appended. The exception is attributive non-past, where the conjugation is not only different but also situational. 

-# Polite forms do not have an attributive form.

な is for an adjectival noun that is modifying a noun. It is also able to replace ～である when the sentence is existential in nature.

の is for a noun modifying another noun. の is a case particle that attaches to the specifier of the following item. For example, 「**雲**の形」 — "Shape of a **cloud**." Multiple のs can be chained together. An interesting use of の is where the next noun is a relative noun (e.g., 下). This will produce adverbs such as through, while, and after. For example, 「**子供の頃**は病弱でした。」 — "I was sickly **when I was a kid**." 

-# An adjectival noun may be a specifier if it is what is known as a "no-adjectival noun." Compared to な, の is more empathetic and "personal."

である attaches to the predicate of a clause that is modifying a noun. This predicate can either be a noun or adjectival-noun. Interestingly, the adjectival-noun can be the predicate for the entire sentence and can still be attached with ～である.
