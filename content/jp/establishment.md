# Establishment Marker に
Establishment describes the state of the subject. に is a case particle specifically for this.

## Location
One use of に is to denote the location, whether or not literal or moving, of the verb. Regarding literal, take the sentence, 「彼女は**男の子**に人気がある。」 — "She has popularity among **boys**." Her possession (marked with the object marker が) can be found with boys.

## Direction
For motion verbs (e.g., 来る), に marks the destination. This destination need not be a physical place. For example, 「今期の利益は**百億円**に達しました。」 — "This term's profits reached **ten billion yen**."

The case particle へ, pronounced "e," can substitute に in only this circumstance. The destination is typically far and abstract (e.g., a city). A limitation is that へ always implies going off somewhere, so it is frequently not used with 来る. Alternatively, the speaker is trying to be less direct and/or more formal. へと is a stronger variant that emphasizes direction; it is almost always interchangeable with へ.

-# へ and に disappear in casual speech, at least for this purpose. 

This notion drives に as an *indirect object marker*. An indirect object is simply another, optional entity that is associated with the action. It commonly is the recipient—the destination. Consider, 「ケイトさんは**テイラー君**にチョコをくれました。」 — "Kate-san gave **Taylor-kun** chocolate." に may appear for intransitive verbs and adjectives. For an adjectival example, 「セスさんは**カタルーニャ語**にも詳しいですよ。」 — "Seth-san is also knowledgeable in **Catalan**."

-# The direct object in English can sometimes be the indirect object in Japanese.
