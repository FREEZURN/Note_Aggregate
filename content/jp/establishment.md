# Establishment Marker に
Establishment describes the state of the subject. に is a case particle specifically for this.

## Location
に denotes the location of the action. This location may be literal or abstract, and still or moving. An abstract location would be, 「彼女は**男の子**に人気がある。」 — "She has popularity among **boys**." A moving location would be, 「**バス**に乗りました。」 — "I rode the **bus**." With に, the action has a *deep intrinsic connection with the place*. This would include states of being (i.e., unconsciously), but also when the action is fixated on a well-defined place (e.g., the bus).

-# に may be dropped to lessen the emphasis on location.

で is when the location and action *do not have a deep intrinsic relationship*. To demonstrate its difference with に, consider the sentence 「ここで働いています。」 — "I'm working here." I don't feel attached to the organization (i.e., temporary job or not too involved); I'm just working. On the other hand, when で is replaced with に, I feel as though I'm part of the organization; I work here, and my occupation is part of my state of being.

## Destination
に marks the destination for motion verbs (e.g., 来る). This destination need not be a physical place. For example, 「今期の利益は**百億円**に達しました。」 — "This term's profits reached **ten billion yen**."

へ, pronounced /e/, is a case particle that can substitute に. The destination is typically far and abstract to a degree. Regarding abstract, a desk would not fit this criteria but a restaurant would. Alternatively, the speaker is trying to be less direct and/or more formal. へ always implies going off somewhere, so it is not paired with arrival often (e.g., 来る). The circumstance in which へ does appear with 来る is when they're still on the way or the destination is open to interpretation. Two sentences to consider: 「彼は間もなくここへ来ます」　— "He will be here shortly;" 「ここへ座って話を聴いてください」 — "Come and sit down \[**around**\] here and listen." 

-# へ and に often disappear in casual speech.
