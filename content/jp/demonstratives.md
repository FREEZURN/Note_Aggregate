# こそあど
**Demonstratives** can be used as a pronoun or attributively. Either way, there are multiple to choose from depending on the distance of the entity from the speaker and/or listener. 

## Entities
| *Nominal* form | Close to... <br> (Physical) | Aware by... <br> (Non-physical) |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| これ | Speaker | Speaker (immediately) | 
| それ | Listener | Exclusively either |
| あれ | Neither | Both |

-# The farther limit of それ is just out of arm's reach.

-# Common contractions replace the ～れ**は** with ～りゃ or ～ら. The latter often carries an angry tone.

-# Replacing ～れ with ～いつ is a casual or vulgar way to refer to people (or things for the singular case).

To use these *attributively*, replace the ～れ with ～の.

どそあど already has plural capabilities stock. However, the suffix ～ら pluralizes pronouns, and こそあど is no exception. This is used to highlight each item's individuality. For example, 「**これらの５人**のうち、サッカー世界選手権で一位となった人は誰でしょう。」 — "Of **these five individuals**, who will become number one in the soccer championship?" There is interest in each individual competitor; each has a chance of winning. To use this plural demonstrative attributively, follow it with の.

-# あれら is really only used when the speaker is declaring that the listener is aware about the entity too. 

## Locations & Situations
こそあど also includes demonstratives *specifically for locations and situations* (e.g., a party). These cover the words "here" and "there." The Japanese versions are ここ, そこ, and あそこ. To use it attributively, simply append ～の. For example, 『**そこのお姉さん**、あの、財布を落としましたよ。』 — "**Miss \[there\]**, um, you dropped your wallet." To add the nuance "about" or "around," append ～ら辺.
