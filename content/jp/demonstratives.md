# こそあど
**Demonstratives** can be used as a pronoun or attributively. Which to use actually depends on the distance of the entity from the speaker and/or listener. 

## This & That
Refer to the following table when the entity is physical.

| *Nominal* form | Close to... |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| これ | Speaker |
| それ | Listener |
| あれ | Neither |

-# The farther limit of それ is just out of arm's reach.

-# Common contractions replace the ～れ**は** with ～りゃ or ～ら. Except in some dialects, the latter often carries an angry tone.

-# Replacing ～れ with ～いつ is a way to refer to people, typically. They are only to be used in casual or vulgar speech registers.

The entity need not be physical. It could be the area, or consider the sentence 『**その学生さん**は誰ですか。』 — "Who is **that student**?" The student very much is human, but the question is about their character. In any case:
- これ: immediately relevant to the speaker (and likely the listener, too)
- それ: *either* speaker or listener have been aware of it
- あれ: *both* speaker and listener have been aware of it

When used attributively, replace the ～れ with ～の. For example 『**この**机は古いです。』 — "**This** desk is old." The reason to go with this method is for the ability to explicitly mention the entity.

There is also a prenomial form, which is also attributive. However, unlike the strictly attributive form, the noun it attaches to is not the entity. What happens is that the noun is made contextually related to the entity. To produce such a form, simply append ～の to the nominal form. This allows us to create sentences like, 『**それの何**がいけないですか。』 — "**What of that** is wrong?" Note that the noun cannot be easily translated with "the" (e.g., "the what" is not grammatical).

## These & Those
The suffix ～ら *only* follows pronouns. Therefore, it can follow the nominal forms of こそあど. The demonstrative can modify another noun with a の (there is no prenomial form). However, こそあど do not require the ～ら suffix to become "these" and "those;" they, by default, have plural capabilities if the context permits. Instead, the ～ら suffix is used to highlight differences among the items.

-# Works on the casual or vulgar forms too.

これら and それら emphasizes each and every single item—individuality. For example, **これらの５人**のうち、サッカー世界選手権で一位となった人は誰でしょう。 "Of **these five individuals**, who will become number one in the soccer championship?" There is great meaning behind each competitor, all of whom have a shot at winning. 

-# あれら denotes individuality too, but it is really only used when the speaker declares that the listener (plus the speaker themself) is knowledgeable about the entity. 

## Here & There
こそあど also includes demonstratives *specifically for locations and situations* (e.g., party). These use the same starting mora as the previously-covered こそあど (with the same distance and awareness limitations). To use it attributively, simply append ～の to the word. For example, 『**そこのお姉さん**、あの、財布を落としましたよ。』 — "**Miss \[there\]**, um, you dropped your wallet." To add the nuance "about" or "around," append ～ら辺. 
- ここ: "here"
- そこ: "there"
- あそこ: "over there"
