# Verbs
Verbs have an attributive and predicative form. For an example of the attributive form, consider the sentence 『食べる野菜』 *"Vegetables that \[I || one\] eat(s)."*

## Ichidan
Verbs of this type end in ～る, and it is this that gets replaced in conjugations.

-# Not all verbs ending in ～る are ichidan verbs.

**Basic:**

| Non-past | Past | Negative | Negative-Past |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------------- |
| ～る | ～た | ～ない | ～なかった |

**Polite:**

| Non-past | Past | Negative | Negative-Past |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------------- |
| ～ます | ～ました | ～ません <br> ～ないです | ～ませんでした <br> ～なかったです |

-# Polite conjugations do possess an attributive form, but it is seen as ungrammatical by many.

## Godan
These verbs end in one of the various "-u" syllabaries. It's this mora that gets altered in conjugations. However, do note that W-type godan verbs actually end with う. 

For the following conjugation tables, verbs ending with ～む will be the example. Notice not only what gets added onto it, but also how the "-m" stays.

-# For W-type godan verbs, ～う will conjugate to ～い or ～わ.

**Basic:**
| Non-past | Past | Negative | Negative-Past |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------------- |
| ～ぬ | *Refer to the table below* | ～なない | ～ななかった |

*Past*
| Type | Conjugation |
| ---- | ----------- |
| ～く | ～いた |
| ～ぐ | ～いだ |
| ～す | ～した |
| ～ぬ <br> ～ぶ <br> ～む | ～んだ |
| ～つ <br> ～る <br> ～う | ～った |

行く conjugates into 行った. 言う is sometimes pronounced ゆう in casual speech.

**Polite:**
| Non-past | Past | Negative | Negative-Past |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------------- |
| ～にます | ～にました | ～にません <br> ～なないです | ～にませんでした <br> ～ななかったです |

-# Polite conjugations do possess an attributive form, but it is seen as ungrammatical by many.

## "To Do" する
する has many uses. What immediately comes to mind is the phrase "To X," 『Xをする。』 X can either be a verb or noun. More crucially, する (and its conjugations) can turn nouns into verbs by simply attaching to them, for the most part anyway.

There are several other ways this verb can be used. The following list is a couple:
- "To cost," where the price "modifies" (as an adverb) する
- "To wear an accessory," transitive
- "To sense," the five senses or emotion

**Basic:**

| Non-past | Past | Negative | Negative-Past |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------------- |
| する | した | しない | しなかった |

**Polite:**

| Non-past | Past | Negative | Negative-Past |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------------- |
| します | しました | しません <br> しないです | しませんでした <br> しなかったです |

## "To come" 来る
来る means "to come" to a place the speaker is, or will be, in. Consider 『明日のパーティに来る？』 — "Will you come to \[my || the\] party tomorrow?" for a "will be in" example. "Coming" can either be spatial or temporal. For a temporal example, 『ついに春が来た！』 — "Spring has finally come!" 

The following conjugations concern the pronunciations; the first mora is typically replaced with 来.

**Basic:**

| Non-past | Past | Negative | Negative-Past |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------------- |
| くる | きた | こない | こなかった |

**Polite:**

| Non-past | Past | Negative | Negative-Past |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------------- |
| きます | きました | きません <br> こないです | きませんでした <br> こなかったです |

## Existential: ある & いる
**ある** is a godan verb with *irregular conjugations for plain negatives*: ない and なかった. **いる** is an ichidan verb. They indicate states of being.

As an existential verb, it can be roughly understood as, "There is \<object\>." ある is for inanimate objects or abstract ideas; いる is for something alive and animate. There are some additional notes on いる: it can personify, and it can also imply animacy and that the state of being is fleeting.  For example, 「あそこにバスがいる」 — "There is a bus **\[that had just finished transit\]** over there."

-# Dead things, especially humans and pets, are commonly paired with いる.

-# おる is a dialectal variant of いる.

Showing existence is only applicable when the object is naturally there or it is obvious how the object got there. 「冷蔵庫にはケーキがある」 — "There is a cake in the refrigerator," the cake was obviously put in by somebody.

Another crucial use of these verbs is to communicate that the \<subject\> has the \<object\>. いる does also cover blood relationships.
