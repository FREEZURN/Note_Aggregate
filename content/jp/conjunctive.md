# Conjunctive Particle て
To connect independent clauses, conjugate the predicate of the earlier clause with て. 

## Affirmative
**Basic:**

| Part of speech | Conjugation |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Copula | で |
| Adjective | ～くて　|
| Verb | Replace ～た of past conjugation with ～て <br> (or ～だ with ～で) |

**Polite:**

| Part of speech | Conjugation |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Copula | でして |
| Adjective | TBD　|
| Verb | Replace ～た of polite past conjugation with ～て |

Of course, there is always the option to split the clauses into individual sentences. However, one reason to use the te-form is to convey that the events of this clause lead to those of the next. For example, 「この日本語の文章が複雑で、よく分かりませんでした。」 — "This Japanese passage was complicated, *and so* I didn’t understand it well." 

There are some additional functions exclusive to verbs. Actions often occur in the same order as they appear. If the actions have different agents, then the actions happen in tandem. Two verbs may be compounded by a te-form conjugation on the first verb. Thus, the first verb sets the tone and the second hits the nail on the head. This leads to sentences like, 「真意を**見て取る**。」 — "To **grasp** the real sense."

て can be used to apply multiple attributes, particularly adjectives and adjectival nouns, but also clauses, to a noun all at once. For example, 「東京は**賑やかで面白い**。」 — "Tokyo **is lively and interesting**." 

## Negative
For *plain* conjugations, replace the ～ない of the negative conjugation with ～なくて or ～ないで.

～なくて is basically a negative version of the affirmative te-form. 「セスは**学生ではなくて**先生だ。」 — "Seth is **not a student** but a teacher."

～ないで is exclusively for verbs. What is shares with ～なくて is in situations where one inaction leads to the next. However, ～ないで is only valid when the subject could've prevented the inaction. For example, 「**日本語の宿題をしないで**セス先生に叱られました。」 — "I got scolded by Seth Sensei **for not doing my Japanese homework**." There is also sentences which list inactions by various subjects. In this case, ～ないで may only be used when the speaker finds said inactions unexpected.

~ないで has some unique nuances. One is to denote that the previous inaction is the method for this action. For example, 「**辞書を使わないで**、手紙を書いた。」 — "I wrote a letter **without using a dictionary**." It is often implied that the inaction is unexpected. Another use is to generate the structure "X instead of Y." For example, 「**お酒を飲まないで**、働いた。」 — "I worked **instead of drinking alcohol**."
