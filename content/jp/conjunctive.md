# Conjunctive Particle て
To connect clauses using the word "and" conjugate with て. 

## Plain
| Part of speech | Affirmative |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Copula | で |
| Adjective | ～くて　|
| Verb | Replace ～た of past conjugation with ～て <br> (or ～だ with ～で) |

## Polite
| Part of speech | Affirmative | Negative |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Copula | でして |
| Adjective | TBD　|
| Verb | Replace ～た of polite past conjugation with ～て |

## Utility
Of course there is always the option to split the clauses into their own sentence. However, one reason to use the te-form is to create a dependent relationship in which the events of the next clause is depending on those of this clause. For example, 「この日本語の文章が複雑で、よく分かりませんでした。」 — "This Japanese passage was complicated, *and so* I didn’t understand it well."

[TODO: agent means doer; the subject basically]: #
There are some extra functions relating to verbs. Actions often occur in the same order as they appear. If the next action is dependent on the previous, then the previous clause can be described as the means to performing the next action. For example, 「**魔法のメガネをかけて**読んだ。」 — "I read it **by putting on magic glasses**." Alternatively, if the actions have different agents, then the actions are happening in tandem with each other. For example 「僕がポケモンをやってテイラー君がフォートナイトをやった。」 — "I played Pokémon and Taylor played Fortnite." Or both verbs are concurrent yet contradict each other. The sentence 「見て見ぬふりをする。」　— "To turn a blind eye," there is 'see' and 'pretending not to see.'

て can be used to apply multiple attributes, particularly adjectives and adjectival nouns but also clauses, to a noun all at once. For example, 「東京は**賑やかで面白い**。」 — "Tokyo **is lively and interesting**." 

[TODO: this て is a final particle despite making up a conjugation]: #
[negative: commanding the action not be done]: #
When the *predicate verb* is in te-form, that means that the associated sentence is a light command. It is often followed by a verb meaning 'to give.' As an example, 「払い戻しをしてください。」 — "Please refund this." The negative conjugations replace ～て with ～ないで. For example, 「見つめないで！」 — "Don't stare \[at me\]!" At the very end, the final particle よ can add a bit of urgency, whereas や creates a scolding tone.

## Negative
For plain negative, replace the ～ない (or ～なかった) with ～なくて or ～ないで.

～なくて is for the general use of the te-form conjugation (conjunctions). This includes demonstrating an inherent dependency on the previous clause. Interestingly, it can uniquely generate the form 'X is not Y but Z.' 「セスは学生ではなくて先生だ。」 — "Seth is not a student but a teacher."

～ないで is exclusively for verbs. It may cover the dependency case if the inaction could've been actively avoided by the subject (～なくて is still valid; just highlighting the dynamic nature). For example, 「**日本語の宿題をしないで**セス先生に叱られました。」 — "I got scolded by Seth Sensei **for not doing my Japanese homework**." One unique use is to signify that the previous action is a (optional, negative) condition that is met as this action is being carried out. For example, 「**辞書を使わないで**、手紙を書いた。」 — "I wrote a letter **without using a dictionary**." This case also covers the dependent relationship thing shared with ～なくて. Another unique use is to generate the structure "X instead of Y." For example, 「**お酒を飲まないで**、働いた。」 — "I worked **instead of drinking alcohol**."

## いる
The affirmative te-form can be followed with ～いる, a supplementary verb that is not synonymous with いる. ～いる can be conjugated as usual to convey tenses, politeness, and negativity. ～ている is commonly contracted to ～てる, even in polite conversation.

The primary use is to generate the progressive form of a verb. In other words, the subject is currently doing it, consciously or not. The verb takes time to occur. As a example, take 「お風呂はもう**沸いています**か。」 — "Is the bath **hot** yet?" This function also covers the progressive perfect tenses (i.e., had been -ing). 

When a state began with an action, and said action is continuing, ～ている may be used. For example, 「この机は**壊れています**。」 — "This desk is **broken**." The desk broke somehow any time ago, and it is still broken now. This use is paired commonly with verbs that happen almost instantly; it happened sometime in an instant, and the state has not changed since. 

-# With motion verbs, the subject made their way to the location, and is still there.

It is able to note that the associated action is something the subject habitually does. For example, 「A学校に**通っています**。」 — "I **go** to School A." Though, it is possible to mistake this use with progressive. ～ている may also be used when talking about actions in the past in a historical manner. Some examples to consider:
- 「アレックスさんはもう10回も日本に**旅行しています**よ。」 — "Alex has already **traveled** to Japan 10 times."
- 「阿部元首相が亡くなってからもう一年**経っている**んだね。」 — "A year has already **passed** since Former Prime Minister Abe passed away, huh."

-# ～ている is often not used with existential verbs, most especially ある and いる.

## ある
Like ～ている, ～てある indicates a state that remains in place. However, it also suggests some knowledge regarding how that state came to be (instead of just saying the action happened and the state persisted since). The predicate verbs it attaches to are transitive and typically have a willingful agent (who had done the action). Ultimately, a *stative verb* is created.

Agency is defined as the relation between the agent to the event. The agent is the subject, but it is not explicitly mentioned. The object (not direct nor indirect) is also the subject, but it is mentioned. 「彼の熱は**計ってある**。」 — "His temperature was **checked** \[**by someone**\]." For past tense, the state could or could not be persisting.
