# Subject Marker が
**が** is a *case particle* that marks the **subject** of a sentence. A role the subject plays, for instance, is performing (transitive or intransitive) actions described by verbs. Additionally, it is a way to introduce information that is contextually new to the listener. That is not to say that the subject is strictly "unregistered information," though.

## Neutral Statements
One common way to use が is in neutral sentences. Some neutral statements proclaim the existence of or describe the subject. 

The subject "unconsciously" performing an intransitive action is also a neutral statement. For example, 『**台風**が上陸しました。』 — "The **typhoon** landed." 

Describing a feeling from the five senses is a neutral statement as well. However, the subject is not the senser; rather, it is the feeling itself. Dwell on the sentence, 『**寒気**がする。』 — "I'm **chilly**." 

## Exhaustive Listing
In a copular sentence, が conveys a sense of, but not strictly complete, *exclusivity* regarding the subject possessing the quality. For example, 『彼が学生です』 — "\[*Of all the people that could be being talked about*,\] He is *the* student."

-# To reference the "competitors," append のほう to the subject.

In questions, the interrogative is the subject. However, it must be noted that it comes with the implication that there is only one answer. There is also a slight sense of urgency. In the response, the answer is the subject.
