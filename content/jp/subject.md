# Subject Marker が
が is a *case particle* that marks the subject of a sentence. It is typically associated with information that would be new to the listener to some capacity.

-# A case particle attaches to a noun, and describes the role of said noun.

## Neutral Statements
One type of neutral sentence is one that proclaims existence (of the subject). There is also describing the subject with adjectives or adjectival nouns. 

When the subject "unconsciously" performs an intransitive action, it can be described with a neutral statement. For example, 『台風が上陸しました。』 means *"The typhoon landed."* Describing a feeling—sight, sound, smell, taste, touch—also falls into this category. What is felt would be the subject. 

## Exhaustive Listing
Compared to the simple copular sentence structure XはYだ, XがY implies that X and only X (of some set) is Y. At the very least, X is, to a greater degree, Y than other choices. だ can be used at the end.

-# To reference the other choices, append のほう to the subject (before が).

In questions, the interrogative is the subject. However, it must be noted that it comes with the implication that there is only one answer. There is also a slight sense of urgency. The answer becomes the subject of the response.
